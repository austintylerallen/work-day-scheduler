Workday Scheduler

A simple web application for scheduling your work day. This scheduler allows you to enter events for each hour of the standard business day (9AM to 5PM) and saves them locally so you can persist your schedule between browser sessions.



Features

* Display the current date at the top of the calendar.
* Color-code time blocks to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future.
* Enter events for each hour of the work day.
* Save events to local storage so they persist between browser sessions.
* Responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices.



Usage

1. 		Open the web application in your browser.
2.		Each time block represents one hour of the standard business day.
3.		Enter your event or task for each hour into the corresponding textarea.
4.		Click the save button to save your event. You'll see a confirmation message once the event is saved.
5. 		Your events will be saved locally, so you can close the browser and return later to see your schedule.
